Android
Android is one of the most used mobile operating systems worldwide. Due to its technological impact, its open-source code and the possibility of installing applications from third parties without any central control, Android has recently become a malware target. Even if it includes security mechanisms, the last news about malicious activities and AndroidÂ´s vulnerabilities point to the importance of continuing the development of methods and frameworks to improve its security.

To prevent malware attacks, researches and developers have proposed different security solutions, applying static analysis, dynamic analysis, and artificial intelligence. Indeed, data science has become a promising area in cybersecurity, since analytical models based on data allow for the discovery of insights that can help to predict malicious activities.

We can analyze cyber threats using two techniques, static analysis, and dynamic analysis, the most important thing is that these are the approaches to get the features that we are going to use in data science.

Static analysis: it includes the methods that allow us to get information about the software that we want to analyze without executing it, one example of them is the study of the code, their callings, resources, etc.
Dynamic analysis: it is another approach where the idea is to analyze the cyber threat during its execution, in other words, get information about its behavior, some of their features are the netflows.


Results:
Best of Static Analysis was with Decesion Tree Acc: 93.75%
Best of Dynamic Analysis was with Random Forest Acc: 91.72%
